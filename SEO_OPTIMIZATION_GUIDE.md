# SEO Optimization Implementation

## Problem Addressed
The SEO warning "The page does not redirect to the selected target" occurs when there's inconsistency between www and non-www versions of your domain. This can hurt SEO rankings as search engines may treat them as separate sites.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Server-Level Redirects
- **Express Server (server.js)**: Added middleware to redirect www to non-www with 301 status
- **Node.js Server (node_server.js)**: Added redirect handling for www to non-www
- **.htaccess**: Comprehensive Apache configuration for www redirects and other optimizations

### 2. Canonical URLs
- Added `<link rel="canonical" href="https://insignyx.com/" />` to index.html
- This tells search engines which version is the preferred URL

### 3. Enhanced Meta Tags
Added to index.html:
- **Description**: Improved meta description for better search results
- **Keywords**: Relevant keywords for AI and big data services
- **Open Graph**: Social media sharing optimization
- **Twitter Cards**: Twitter-specific sharing optimization

### 4. SEO Files Created
- **robots.txt**: Guides search engine crawlers
- **sitemap.xml**: Helps search engines understand site structure
- **404.html**: Custom error page for better user experience

### 5. Security Headers
Enhanced security headers in all servers:
- X-Content-Type-Options
- X-Frame-Options
- X-XSS-Protection
- Content-Security-Policy

## How It Fixes the SEO Warning

1. **301 Redirects**: When someone visits www.insignyx.com, they're automatically redirected to insignyx.com with a 301 (permanent redirect) status
2. **Canonical URLs**: Search engines know which version is preferred
3. **Consistent URLs**: All internal links point to the non-www version

## Testing the Fix

1. Start your server: `node server.js` or `node node_server.js`
2. Test redirect: Visit `http://www.localhost:8000` (if testing locally)
3. Check canonical URL in page source
4. Verify meta tags are present

## Production Deployment

For production deployment:
1. Ensure your hosting provider supports .htaccess files (Apache) or configure similar rules for Nginx
2. Update canonical URLs to use your actual domain
3. Submit sitemap.xml to Google Search Console
4. Monitor SEO tools for the redirect warning resolution

## Additional Recommendations

1. **SSL Certificate**: Ensure HTTPS is properly configured
2. **Page Speed**: Optimize images and enable compression
3. **Mobile Optimization**: Ensure responsive design works well
4. **Content Quality**: Regularly update content with relevant keywords
5. **Internal Linking**: Ensure all internal links use the preferred domain format

## Files Modified/Created

- ✅ server.js (added www redirect)
- ✅ node_server.js (added www redirect)
- ✅ index.html (enhanced meta tags, canonical URL)
- ✅ .htaccess (comprehensive SEO and security rules)
