**Before (Placeholder):**
```html
<iframe src="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdummy_placeholder_url/viewform?embedded=true">

## 10. Redirect Optimization

### Issue: Unnecessary Redirect Steps
**Date**: Phase 4
**Priority**: HIGH

#### Problem Identified
The original redirect configuration caused multiple redirect steps when users visited `http://www.insignyx.com/`:
1. `http://www.insignyx.com/` → `https://www.insignyx.com/` (HTTP to HTTPS)
2. `https://www.insignyx.com/` → `https://insignyx.com/` (www removal)

This created unnecessary redirect chains that negatively impact SEO and user experience.

#### Solution Implemented

**1. Optimized .htaccess Configuration**
```apache
# Redirect www to non-www with HTTPS in a single step
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^www\.(.*)$ [NC]
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://%1/$1 [R=301,L]

# Force HTTPS for non-www requests only
RewriteCond %{HTTPS} off
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} !^www\. [NC]
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI} [L,R=301]
```

**2. Enhanced Node.js Server**
```javascript
// SEO: Handle www to non-www redirect with proper protocol detection
const host = req.headers.host;
if (host && host.startsWith('www.')) {
  const isHttps = req.headers['x-forwarded-proto'] === 'https' || 
                 req.headers['x-forwarded-ssl'] === 'on' ||
                 req.connection.encrypted;
  const protocol = isHttps ? 'https' : 'http';
  const redirectUrl = `${protocol}://${host.slice(4)}${req.url}`;
  res.writeHead(301, { 'Location': redirectUrl, ...securityHeaders });
  res.end();
  return;
}
```

#### Optimized Redirect Flow
- `http://www.insignyx.com/` → `https://insignyx.com/` ✅ **Single redirect**
- `https://www.insignyx.com/` → `https://insignyx.com/` ✅ **Single redirect**
- `http://insignyx.com/` → `https://insignyx.com/` ✅ **Single redirect**
