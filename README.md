### Offline Usage
All HTML pages reference a precompiled version of Tailwind CSS located in `css/tailwind.min.css`. This allows the site to be viewed without internet access. If you prefer to use the CDN version instead, replace the `<link>` element with the CDN `<script>` tag shown below in the Dependencies section.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The application is built to be fully responsive, providing an optimal viewing experience on various devices.
- **Core Capabilities**: Information on multiple services, including AI consulting, Generative AI Development, Data Engineering Services, and MLOps.
- **Client Showcase**: Displaying logos of prominent clients to build credibility and trust.
- **Engaging Customer Stories**: Section dedicated to case studies that demonstrate the efficacy of the services provided.

## Dependencies

This project utilizes the following dependencies, which are referenced in the `HTML` files:

 - **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for creating custom designs easily.
  When working offline, include the precompiled file in `css/tailwind.min.css`:
  ```html
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/tailwind.min.css">
  ```
  Alternatively, you can still reference the CDN for automatic updates:
  ```html
  <script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
  ```
- **Google Fonts**: For custom font styling.
  ```html
  <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inter:wght@400;600&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
  ```
