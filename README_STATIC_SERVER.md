# How to Serve the Website Locally with CSS Loading

To ensure your CSS files load correctly and the site renders properly, you should serve the website using a local static server instead of opening the HTML files directly in the browser.

## Option 1: Using Python (if Python is installed)

1. Open a terminal in the project root directory.
2. Run the following command:

   For Python 3.x:
   ```
   python3 -m http.server 8000
   ```

3. Open your browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:8000/index.html
   ```

## Option 2: Using npm serve package (if Node.js and npm are installed)

1. Install serve globally (if not already installed):
   ```
   npm install -g serve
   ```

2. Run the server in the project root directory:
   ```
   serve -l 8000
   ```

3. Open your browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:8000/index.html
   ```

This will serve your files with correct MIME types and paths, ensuring CSS and JS files load properly.

If you need help setting this up or want me to generate a simple Node.js static server script, let me know.
